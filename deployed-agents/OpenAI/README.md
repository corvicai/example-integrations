# ðŸŽ® Corvic AI + OpenAI Integration: Structured Data Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate Corvic AI with an OpenAI agent framework to analyze structured data from a parquet file containing video game sales information.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Use Case

In this tutorial, you'll upload a parquet file containing data about video game sales and ask Corvic to provide a report.

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

1. **Download the CSV Dataset**: Obtain the video game sales data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales).

2. **Convert CSV to Parquet**: Use Python to convert the CSV file to Parquet format:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv("vgsales.csv")
   df.to_parquet("vgsales.parquet", index=False)
   ```

3. **Upload to Corvic**: Follow the documentation [here](https://app.corvic.ai/docs/howToUseCorvic#create-pipelines) to create an agent using this parquet file.

4. **Deploy the Agent**: Deploy the agent and obtain the MCP endpoint and access token.
